# Carbon-Emission-Project-SQL
Project Description:
The Carbon Emission Project is a data analysis project aimed at exploring global carbon emission trends using SQL. The project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing carbon emission data to uncover insights into emissions per capita and total emissions across various countries and years.

Key Features:
SQL Analysis: Utilizes SQL queries to clean, transform, and analyze carbon emission data. Features include SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, AGGREGATE functions, and more.
Dataset Overview:
The dataset comprises the Carbon Emission Database, sourced from Kaggle. This database contains carbon emission per capita data for various countries worldwide, providing insights into total carbon emissions and emissions per capita over time.

Tools Used:
SQL: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Project Structure:
SQL Scripts: Contains SQL scripts used for data manipulation and analysis.
Documentation: Includes detailed documentation explaining SQL queries and insights derived from the analysis.
Dataset Files: Optionally includes dataset files, if permitted.
Insights and Findings:
The project aims to reveal key insights into global carbon emission trends, highlighting significant changes over time, identifying countries with high and low emissions, and exploring potential emission reduction strategies.

Contribution and Usage:
Contributions to the project are welcome via issues, feature requests, and pull requests. The project is open-source and distributed under an appropriate license (mention the chosen license). Users can clone the repository, explore the datasets, and analyze the carbon emission data using SQL.
